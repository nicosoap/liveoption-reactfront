*liveoption is the default project name for pojects hosted on liveoption.io

liveoption-reactfront is a reactjs based webapp for a Dating service. It requires matcha API and backend websocket to run, in combination with a mongodb webserver.

The matcha backend project is available at https://github.com/nicosoap/matcha it's based on node.js but a Scala version could be a future project of mine.
